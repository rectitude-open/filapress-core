This is the core package for [FilaPress](https://github.com/rectitude-open/filapress). It acts as a central integration point, bundling various Filament plugins and managing their policies, configurations, and migrations. FilaPress itself relies on this single core package, which then orchestrates other underlying plugins, simplifying overall extension management.
